# checkBoreholeFlowRate.sh â€” A Script to calculate recent flow rate readings. Adapted and striped down version of averageFlowRate.sh. see that script for more explaination.
# It differs by NOT creating an average of the flowrates, instead it just notifies us of recent recordings
# Works by finding all occurences when the lines are not loading tankers.
# Then looks for the matching tank readings and stores any where at least one inlet is open.
# Then comparing the location of the found results and if there are two consequtive timestamps when we are not pumping and when the inlets are open it stores these
# Usage: checkBoreholeFlowRate.sh
