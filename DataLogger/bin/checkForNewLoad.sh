# checkForNewLoad.sh â€” Adds a new load to the load_log.txt and sends a push notification to alert us when we detect a new load
# Usage: checkForNewLoad.sh
# Author: Charlie Marshall
# License: MIT

# 'load_log.txt'  contains a single line per load including delivery date
# Push notifications are sent every time a new connection / load is deteced
# Push Alarms are sent when the temperature, ph or conductivity is out of spec or the tank levels are low
