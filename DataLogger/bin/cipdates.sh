# using tac = data is read in reverse ie post cip is read first, then cleaning and finally pre cip data is read last
# for every line which has an Out Of Spec PH level, append it to cip[A|B($3)] and set the following data (NR+2) to be queeued for printing
# if the following NR+2 is recorded during CIP, it is appended to the cip[A|B] and then skipped (next)
# for any NR+2 which is not during CIP ie pre CIP, we print the post CIP data followed by all CIP data and then the pre CIP data and reset cip[]
