# getForecastData.sh â€” A script to gather the data required to plot the forecast graph
# Usage: getForecastData.sh
# Author: Charlie Marshall
# License: MIT
#
# The flowrate is passed to awk as a variable. It is the latest recording in the dailyFlowRate.dat file
# The volumes of litres in the road tankers are calculated using the last 2 lines of the panel_log.txt file
# The storage tank levels and the maximum storage level are calculated using the last 3 lines of the tank_log.txt file
#
# The variables are then output to the terminal separated by newlines. The webGUI can then split these up in PHP and assign them to the correct boxes
# The script ecoPlanning.sh is run inside awk as we still have named access to the variables, this creates a data file to allow us to plot a graph
# Once the awk script has finished we plot the graph using gnuPlot

####  Panel log
# $1 = load number
# $2 = date and time stamp
# $3 = Point (A or B)
# $4 = Tank (1,2 or 3
# $5 = PH
# $6 = Conducitivity
# $7 = Temp
# $8 = Status (OFFLINE, PAUSED, LOADING)
# $9 = Set Level (29500)
# $10 = Pumped
# $11 = Flowrate
# $12 = Minutes Remaining

#### Tank log
# $1 = Tank number (1, 2 or 3)
# $2 = date and time stamp
# $3 = Point (A, B, or Offline)
# $4 = Tank Level
# $5 = Autofill (ON or OFF)
# $6 = Tank Set Level
# $7 = Inlet (OPEN or CLOSED)
