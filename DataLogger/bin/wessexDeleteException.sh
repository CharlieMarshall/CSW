# ls : List directory contents.

# tail : Output the last part of files.
# -n +11 : output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +NUM to output starting with line NUM
# xargs : Build and execute command lines from standard input.
# -r : don't run if there are no files to delete

###### MAKE SURE WE CD IN TO THE DIR OTHERWISE WE WILL BE DELETING FILES FROM OUR CURRENT DIR!!!! #####
